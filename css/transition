            transition

The 'transiton' properly in css is used to create smooth animations when changing the properties of an element. it allow you to control the speed of these properly changes over a specified duration, rather than having them occur instantaneously.


syntax:

transition: property duration timing-function delay;


components of a transition

1. "property"

"Description": specifies the css property that the transition effect is applied to (e.g., 'width', 'height', 'background', etc...).

special values: 'all' applies the transition to all changeable properties 


example:

transition: background-color 0.5s ease;


2. duration:

 "description": specifies the lenght of time the transition takes to complete. the duration is defined in seconds ('s') or milliseconds ('ms')


 example:

 transition: background-color 2s;

 3. timing-function:

 define the speed curve of the transition. it controls hoe the intermediate state of the transition are calculated.


 common values:

 - 'ease' : starts slow, then fast, then ends slow (default value).
 - 'linear' : constant speed from start to end.
  - 'ease-in' : start slow, then fast.
   - 'ease-out' : start fast, then slow.
    - 'ease-in-out' : starts slow, speeds up, then slow down.



example:

transition: width 2s ease-in;


4. delay:

description: specifies a delay before the transition starts. this can be in seconds ('s') or milliseconds ('ms").

example:

transition: height 0.5s

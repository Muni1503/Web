- an HSL color values is specified with hsl() function.

- syntax: hsl (hue, saturation, lightness).
- hue is a degree on the color wheel (from 0 to 360). 0 is red , 120 is green, 240 is blue.
- saturation is percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray and 100% is the full color.
- lightness is also a percentage, 0% is black, 100% is white.


HSLA:

- HSLA color value are an extention of hsl color value with an alpha, channel which specifics the opacity of the object.
- an HSLA color value is specified with hsla() function. 
- syntax: hsla (hue, saturation, lightness, alpha).
- the alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque).


HEXADECIMAL COLOR:

- a hexadecimmal color is specified with: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green), BB (BLUE) hexadecimal integer specify the components of the color. all values must be between 00 and FF.

HEXADECIMAL color with TRANSPARENCY:
